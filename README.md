Final project for ME 506 (Two-Phase Flow and Heat Transfer) at Purdue University taught by Professor Mudawar of the Mechanical Engineering department. 

# Dynamics of pipes conveying two-phase flows

Solves the equation of motion (EoM) for pipes conveying two-phase flows using the Galerkin method; a fluid-structure interaction problem. Used to study the dynamics of the pipe, such as the response, bifurcations, and critical flow velocities, for different two-phase flow parameters. The image below represents vertical downflow in a cantilever pipe, reproducing literature results of <em>Paidoussis and Issid (1974)</em> for the case where the fluid is a liquid only.
