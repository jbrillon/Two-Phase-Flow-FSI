Final project for ME 506, Two-Phase Flow and Heat Transfer, at Purdue University, taught by Professor Mudawar of the Mechanical Engineering department. 

# Dynamics of pipes conveying two-phase flows

Solves the equation of motion (EoM) for pipes conveying two-phase flows using the Galerkin method; a fluid-structure interaction problem. Used to study the dynamics of the pipe, such as the response, bifurcations, and critical flow velocities, for different two-phase flow parameters.
